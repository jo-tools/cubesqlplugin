RB Plugin Converter v2.0
---------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
	This program can be used to create a new RBX plugin from platform-specific plugin parts.  You can either use the command line program if you wish to script the process, or you can use the GUI program if you'd prefer.

Known issues:
-------------
	* When converting a folder hierarchy, it will recursively add all the folders even if RB itself does not use them.  
	
	* The program is also not smart about telling you if a folder is missing that should be included, or whether the hierarchy is valid or not.
	

Source Code:
------------
	The source code is freely available for you to use or to modify.  For more information about the license to the source code, please see the License.txt file.  There are two REALbasic projects included in this download.  One is the command line application which drives the RBX file creation, and the other is a GUI wapper application.  Both projects were created with and are supported on REALbasic 2007 Release 5.

How to use:
-----------
	To use the command line application, enter PluginConverter.exe -? to display the help and example usages.  To create a new plugin using the GUI, launch the Plugin Creator application and add the plugin parts directly via the UI.  Click the Save button to create the RBX plugin.


Overview of folder hierarchy:
-----------------------------
The plugin converter can convert a folder structure into an RBX file using the -f command line switch.  The structure of the folder should match the following diagram:

+-Plugin Name					// name of your plugin
	+- Build Resources			// includes the necessary shared libraries
		+-Linux X86			// For Linux/x86 target
		+-Mac Carbon Mach-O		// For Carbon/Mach-O
		+-Mac Carbon Mach-O Universal	// For Carbon Mach-O Universal
		+-Mac Cocoa			// For Cocoa Mach-O Universal
		+-Windows			// For Windows
	+- IDE Resources			// includes the pictures/docs for your plugin
		+-Controls Palette		// includes the icon you'd see in the toolbar
		+-Help				// plugin docs, must include index.html

Note that the GUI uses a less obsolete naming convention, so the names will not match up exactly.

What the platform sub categories mean:
--------------------------------------
	To provide a way to customize your plugin to fit the OS, you can add your resources inside platform sub folders, for example:

	+IDE Resources
		+-Controls Palette
			  128.bmp
			  128mask.bmp
			+-Mac OS
			+-Windows
			+-Windows 98-NT
			+-Windows XP
				  128.bmp
				  128mask.bmp

For example, if you want a different looking picture to appear on the Windows IDE running on XP, you could include a picture inside the sub folder "Windows XP".  RB will first look inside this folder for any pictures, if it doesn't find one, it will look at the other Windows folders and lastly, the top level "Controls Palette" folder.  Note that the picture filename must match the id number (i.e. the toolbarPICT field of the REALcontrol struct, yeah the name needs changing) that you defined for your control.  At this time, only BMP picture files are supported.  Attempting to include any other type of picture format will cause problems.

Plugin Help Reference:
----------------------
	With the RBX plugin format, developers can now include HTML documentation that can be referenced from within the IDE.  If a plugin includes documentation, a new menu item will appear under the Help menu in the RB IDE.  Documentation is valid ONLY IF you include a file named "index.html" inside the Help folder.

	+-IDE Resources
		+-Help
			  index.html
			  pic.jpg
			  another.html
			  another2.html

If RB does not find this one critical file, the menu item will not appear, and thusly no documentation can be referenced.  You may include multiple files, but no sub folders inside the Help folder will be recognized.
