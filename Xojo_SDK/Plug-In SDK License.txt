1.	DEFINITIONS. In this License Agreement, SDK means the API

items, all as delivered to you by XOJO INC and included within the 
Plug-In SDK folder when installed. The Plug-In software placed on

executing the SDK installer are part of the SDK. XOJO INC Products refer 
to XOJO INC's application programs and software such as Xojo 
Plug-Ins which are or may be made available for licensing to the 
general public, including any modified versions or upgrades thereof.

commercial product, that XOJO INC has included for You as part of the 
SDK to distribute unmodified with Your application programs. Sample 
Code means software code that XOJO INC has included for You to 
incorporate into Your application programs. Tools refer to programs 
and Utilities that may be included for You to test or compile Your 
application programs. XOJO INC means XOJO Incorporated. 
Developer, You and Your refer to any person or entity acquiring or 
using the SDK under the terms of this License Agreement.

2.	ROYALTY-FREE LICENSE.  Subject to the restrictions contained 
in this Section 2, XOJO INC grants to You a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the items in the SDK 
only for the purpose of internal development of application programs 
designed to function with XOJO INC products.

Under this License, You may use, modify or merge all or portions of 
the Sample Code with Your application programs and distribute it only 
as part of Your products in object code form. Any modified or merged 
portion of the Sample Code is subject to this License Agreement. You 
are required to include XOJO INC's copyright notices on Your application 
programs except for those programs in which You include a copyright 
notice reflecting the copyright ownership of Developer in such 
programs. You may not use XOJO INC's name, logo or trademarks to market 
Your products. You may not assign Your rights or obligations granted 
under this License Agreement without the prior written consent of

written consent from XOJO INC shall be void and of no effect.

You may use the XOJO INC Products included in the SDK, if any, subject 
to End User Licenses or conditions stated on the specific XOJO INC

in the SDK solely for the purpose of internal development. You may 
not include XOJO INC Products and Tools and accompanying materials in 
the SDK in Developers products under this License Agreement. You may 
not sell, sublicense, rent, loan or lease the XOJO INC Products, Tools 
and accompanying materials in the SDK to any third party. You may not 
reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any XOJO INC Products, API 
development software or Tools that are supplied to You under this 
License Agreement. To the extent that local law grants You the right 
to decompile software in order to obtain information necessary to 
render the software interoperable with other software, You shall 
first request to XOJO INC in writing to provide You with the necessary 
information. XOJO INC has the right to impose reasonable conditions such 
as a reasonable fee for doing so. Requests for information should be 
directed to the XOJO INC at the address provided in the SDK or such

business purposes, and such employees or consultants shall be subject 
to this License Agreement.

You may use API development software only as provided in the XOJO INC 
specification applicable thereto, and distribute it solely with Your 
products on the same media. You may not modify API development 
software. The API development software may be distributed to Your 
customers under the terms of Your standard End User License Agreement 
provided it includes terms which are substantially similar to those 
applicable to the API development software, as described herein.

THE SDK OR ANY SERVICES RELATED TO THE SDK.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation 
of incidental, consequential or special damages, or the exclusion of 
implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may 
last, so the above limitations may not apply to You. You may have 
rights which vary from state to state or jurisdiction to

Developer, end user or to any other party. XOJO INC is acting on behalf 
of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or 
restricting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this 
Clause 5, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.

6.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.   Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this License Agreement, XOJO INC's liability to You under 
this License Agreement shall be limited to the amount paid by You for 
the SDK.

IN NO EVENT WILL XOJO INC BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR ANY LOST PROFITS,

REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, 
OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY PARTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or special 
damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.

rights of any party dealing as a consumer.

7.	INDEMNIFICATION.  Developer agrees to indemnify, hold 
harmless, and defend XOJO INC from and against any claims or lawsuits, 
including attorneys' fees, that arise or result from the use or 
distribution of Developer's products containing Sample Code or API 
development software, provided that XOJO INC gives Developer prompt 
written notice of any such claim, tenders to Developer the defense or 
settlement of such a claim at Developer's expense and cooperates with 
Developer, at Developer expense, in defending or settling such claim.

8.	CHOICE OF LAW.  This License Agreement shall be governed by 
the laws in force in the State of Texas in the United States, 
excluding the application of its conflict of law rules. This License 
Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on 
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of 
which is expressly excluded.

product that includes Sample Code or API development software (i) 
will include in its license agreement a reference to applicable U.S. 
Government regulations that control licensing of software, and (ii) 
will not be shipped, transferred or exported into any country or used

shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the 
part of XOJO INC, its agents or employees, but only by an instrument in 
writing signed by an officer of XOJO INC.

11.	INTEGRATION.  When conflicting language exists between this 
License Agreement and any other agreement included in the SDK, this

employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to 
this License Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to 
recover reasonable attorneys' fees. You acknowledge that You have 
read this License Agreement, understand it and that it is the 
complete and exclusive statement of Your agreement with XOJO INC which 
supersedes any prior agreement, oral or written, between XOJO INC and 
You with respect to the licensing to You of the SDK. No variation of

unless XOJO INC gives its express consent, in writing signed by an
