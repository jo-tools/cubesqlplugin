HiDPI Plugins SDK Update (2016r1)
The SDK has been updated to support HiDPI.

- Plugins can now specify larger images to be displayed in the Xojo library pane. See the plugin packaging guide for more details.

- A scaleFactorChangedFunction callback has been added to REALcontrolBehaviour.

- REALLoadSharedMethod has been added.

- Fixed an issue that prevented building with GCC.


Plugins SDK 64-bit (2015r3)
The SDK has been updated to support 64-bit and get some general cleaning up. This release does break source compatibility, but there are no binary incompatible changes.

- The required version of Visual Studio is now 2010 or higher.

- Moved all deprecated functions into their own file. This file is included automatically when you include 'rb_plugin.h' for compatibility.

- Added dynamic API functions that specifically deal with Integer, Boolean, and Color. 32-bit plugins will continue to function when the old overloads are called, but 64-bit plugins must invoke the correct function for the data type in question.

- Added kTypeInteger to be used when creating an array of Integers.

- REALcontrolInstance, REALpopupMenu, REALmemoryBlock, REALsocket, REALgraphics, REALpicture, REALfolderItem, REALappleEvent, and REALwindow have been made typedefs of REALobject.

- All overloads of REALGetPropValue, REALSetPropValue, REALInsertArrayValue, REALGetArrayValue, and REALSetArrayValue have been deprecated in favor of explicitly typed functions.

- Some functions have been marked unavailable in 64-bit to avoid ambiguity. Their replacements are explicitly marked in the plugin headers.

- The plugins SDK no longer requires using C++. Plugins can now be written in straight C.

- Removed support for Carbon-based plugins.

- Plugins no longer require the use of prefix headers, just the inclusion of 'rb_plugin.h'. The prefix headers remain in the SDK for backwards compatibility purposes.

- REALstring is now completely opaque and has no member functions. Plugins should use REALStringLength, REALGetStringContents, or REALGetStringData instead.

- Non-deprecated functions that previously returned Boolean now return bool.

- Callback functions defined on REALcontrolBehaviour that previously returned Boolean now return RBBoolean (not bool).

- More function pointers have been made strongly typed instead of using REALproc.

- Some functions have had their return type or parameter types changed. These are minimal and typically are either specifying an explicitly sized type rather than 'long' or changing the signedness of a type.

- Plugin structures no longer have to be the same number of bytes across all platforms as of 2015r3. This is a runtime change and is mentioned here for completeness.


Plugin SDK 11

- Added shared properties/methods, enums and delegates to REALcontrol
- Added enums and delegates to REALclass
- Added delegates to REALmoduleDefinition
- Added additional member to REALcursorUpdate to identify the intended type of the value


Plugin SDK 10

- Adjusted structure sizes for Attribute support, this means that any plug-ins built with this version cannot be used in Real Studio 2011r3 or earlier.
- Removed obsolete or old plug-in examples (most of them still relied on CodeWarrior)

- Added a more up-to-date example, see Eye Control
